            <h2>The Life of Loki</h2>
        </div>
        <p>Loki, in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norse_mythology#:~:text=The%20northernmost%20extension%20of%20Germanic,manuscripts%2C%20archaeological%20representations%2C%20and%20folk">Norse</a> mythology, is a crafty trickster known for his ability to change his shape and gender. Although his father was the giant FÃ¡rbauti, Loki was counted among the Aesir, a group of gods. He often accompanied the powerful gods Odin and Thor, using his wit to assist them, but his actions sometimes led to embarrassment or trouble for both them and himself. Loki also played the role of an antagonist, crashing the gods' feasts and demanding their drink.</p>
