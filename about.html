            <h2>Loki's Origins</h2>
            <div>
                <p>Loki's father is Farbauti, a giant known for his destructive nature. His name means "cruel striker," and he is often associated with dangerous forces like lightning or wild fire. This connection to chaos plays a significant role in shaping Loki's character.</p>
                <p>Loki's mother is Laufey, a goddess, whose name means "leafy" or "wooded isle," suggesting a connection to nature. Interestingly, unlike most Norse figures who are named after their fathers, Loki is often called "Loki Laufeyjarson," meaning "Loki, son of Laufey". This highlights her significance in his life, despite her relatively unknown role in the myths. Some interpretations suggest she was a weaker figure physically, but she was still central to Loki's identity and upbringing.</p>
                <p>This mixed parentage gives Loki a dual nature, part giant and part god. As a giant, he's connected to the chaotic and untamed forces of the world, but through his close ties to the gods, particularly Odin and Thor, he also has a place in Asgard. This blend of influences helps explain Loki's unpredictable behavior. Sometimes he aids the gods, while at other times, he causes trouble and destruction. Loki's origins, with a chaotic father and a more nurturing mother, help define his role in Norse mythology as both a helper and a troublemaker, shifting between the worlds of the gods and the giants.</p>
