            <h3>Loki's Escapades</h3>
            <h2>Baldur's Death</h2>
            <p>The gods decided to punish Loki severely after the death of Baldur. According to the story, Loki found out that Baldur, the favorite of all gods, had one weakness, he could be harmed with a mistletoe. Loki then created a mistletoe arrow and gave it to Hodr, the blind god and tricked him into shooting it at Baldur. Hodr, who did not know that he was being used, hit Baldur with the arrow and he died instantly. This sad occurrence  marked the beginning of Ragnarok, the end of the world. The death of Baldur was unbearable and with this the gods decided that it was time to give Loki a punishment that he could not avoid.</p>
            <h2>Sif's Hair</h2>
            <p>Sif, who was the wife of Thor, the God of Thunder, had very beautiful golden hair. One day, out of boredom, Loki cut Sif's hair without any reasoning. Thor caught him and wanted to kill him but Loki convinced Thor to spare his life with the agreement that he would right his wrongs.In order to that, Loki visited a group of dwarves and sought for their help. The dwarfs created new beautiful golden hair for Sif.</p>
            <h2>The Treasures</h2>
            <p>After Loki cut off Sif's hair, he tried to find a way to fix his mistake and eventually found a group of dwarves who made valuable treasures for him. Loki was so happy with the treasures that he kept bragging to everyone about them. He showed the treasures to another group of dwarves and made a bet with them that they couldn't produce something as special. The dwarves who were eager to prove him wrong, begun their mission. Soon Loki realized that they were in fact able to create something similar and he got scared. He decided to shapeshift into a fly and stung one of the dwarves on the hand. The dwarves were still able to complete the mission and that was the origin story of Mjolnir, the hammer.</p>
            <h2>Shapeshifting</h2>
            <p>A giant builder asked for the Sun, the Moon, and beautiful goddess Freya if he could be allowed to build the protective walls for Asgard. The gods agreed to his terms because they thought that this giant builder would not be able to finish the work on time. But with the help of the great horse, the giant builder was able to work at a very fast rate. Loki then thought of how the giant could not finish the job. He turned into a mare and had sexual intercourse with the stallion of the giant builder. Since the stallion followed the track of Loki, the giant could complete the job on time. The giant builder was later on slain by Thor while Loki on the other hand gave birth to the eight legged horse known as Sleipnir.</p>
